# Carl's Typo Timer
> *made with ❤️ for the codesphere nov-challenge*

 I'm going to have to keep this very short - sorry guys - in the middle of my civil service here in austria - they have me working hard. I am very happy I could find enough time to work on this **Typographic Timer** in my limited free time - though I regret not finding enough to upgrade to NTP.

## TLDR - TYPO TIMER
The numbers are made visible by changing the color of specific spans contained by four 3x5 grids. The color layouts are stored at the bottom of `main.js`. The span's color, which represents the current second, is overridden to orange.

The input dial is inspired by the Timer on Apple iPhones. Made possible with JavaScript and a bit of CSS. There's an index for each dial that is set +1 or -1 depending on the scroll direction - the values had to be capped, of course. The numbers opacity and size change depending on how far they are positioned from the current index.


What a fun challenge! Thank you for the opportunity.
